A segue defines a transition from one view controller to another. It often begins when the user taps a button or table row, and it ends when a new view controller is presented. 
Here, we made an Traffic Segues using Storyboard, where we used actions and outlets and also "Unwind Segue". The main screen is Red indicating "Stop" in Traffic lights when the user clicks button called "Button", it takes them to "Yellow" screen, then followed by "Green" screen. In the end, when user clicks "Exit" button it takes them to main screen, which is "Red" screen.
